Solar Industry AI Assistant - Implementation Guide
Introduction
The Solar Industry AI Assistant is a chatbot that provides insights about solar energy using a knowledge base and AI-powered responses. This guide explains how the assistant was implemented using Gradio and Hugging Face’s GPT-2 model.
Components
1.	Hugging Face API Integration:
The assistant uses the Hugging Face GPT-2 model to generate responses.
                             The API token is required for authentication.
                            The API URL is set to https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/openai-                    community/gpt2.
AS INFERENCE API KEY IS PAID IN HUGGING GPT FROM 2025 SO I DON’T HAVE APPROPRIATE API KEY FOR INTEGRATION THAT’S WHY I USED GPT2 INFERENCE API KEY WHICH I DOWNLOADED IN 2024 FOR MY RESEARCH PROJECT.
2.	Knowledge Base:
A predefined set of information on solar energy, covering:
Solar Panel Technology
Installation Processes
Maintenance Requirements
Cost & ROI Analysis
Industry Regulations
Market Trends
This knowledge is used to guide AI responses and improve accuracy.
3.	Query Processing:
The user’s question is combined with the knowledge base to form an input prompt.
The input is sent to the Hugging Face API with specific parameters to ensure detailed and relevant responses.
The API response is extracted and displayed.
4.	Gradio Interface:
Implemented using gr.Blocks() to structure the UI.
Components used:
gr.Markdown() for headings and descriptions.
gr.Textbox() for user input and AI-generated responses.
gr.Button() to submit queries.
The click() function binds the button to the AI query function.
5.	Launching the Application:
The Gradio interface is launched using demo.launch(share=True), allowing external access to the chatbot.
Enhancements & Future Improvements
Improve Model Responses: Use a more advanced model like GPT-4 or a domain-specific model trained on solar energy.
Database Integration: Store past interactions for better query handling.
Real-time Updates: Fetch and display real-time solar industry trends.
Multilingual Support: Enable responses in different languages for broader accessibility.
This implementation provides an interactive AI-powered chatbot for users interested in solar energy, making technical and industry knowledge easily accessible.
